## With the pip install package :

- Install pyOpt from https://github.com/madebr/pyOpt (optional)

- Install anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)

- Create an environment

- Open the environment terminal

- To install the package, write in the command line :

	```
	pip install Correct-TDS
	```
- To run Correct@TDS, write in the command line :

	```
 	Correct-TDS-interface
	```
- The gui can freeze while computing, it's normal, it's still in development

## Manual instalation

- Install anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)

- Install mpi4py with the command

	```
	conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py
	```

## Usage

A THz software that performs statistical analysis and error correction on .h5 files obtained with TeraHertz Time Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS).
Input file should contains :
 - One dataset with label "timeaxis", containing the sampling times in picoseconds
 - One dataset for each time signal to correct, labeled with their index starting from 0


The optimization process can also be launched from a python code as shown in the example below:

	import Correct_TDS

	opti = Correct_TDS.Optimization()


	#Compulsory initialization step:
	opti.setData(toCorrect)		#indicates the list of pulses to correct
	opti.setReference(ref)		#reference signal
	opti.setTimeAxis(t)			#time axis
	opti.setParameters(fitDelay = True, delayLimit = 1e-14, fitAmplitude=True, amplitudeLimit=1)	#Optimisation choices

	#Launch optimization
	opti.optimize()

	#Get the corrected signals:
	corrected = opti.getCorrectedTraces()
	#Get the correction parameters as a dictionary
	parameters = opti.getCorrectionParameters()
